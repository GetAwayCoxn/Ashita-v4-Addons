# Weather Helper

An addon for Ashita v4 to play a call in party chat when the weather of your choice pops and depops

The only command is:

/weatherhelper or /wh [Fire|Water|Earth|Wind|Ice|Thunder|Light|Dark] to chose which weather you are wanting to be alerted for

It will check for both single and double weather matching your choice

It scans for new weather every 15 seconds because this doesn't use packets
