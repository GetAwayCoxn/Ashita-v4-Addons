# Segments

I got tired of doing math to see how many segments per odyssey run I was getting. This ashita v4 addon is just a quick and dirty display of how many segments you have earned in your odyssey run. It also displays your current total. These amounts are taken from the chat log and not from packet data.

## Basics:

/segs reset -- simply resets the display
