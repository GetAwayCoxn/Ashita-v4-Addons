# Database

An addon for Ashita v4 to track and display various things.

## Commands:

/database or /db to hide|show the gui

## To-Do's
- Still TONS of work I need to do and code clean up and such, feel free to try this out and give feedback
- I am currently using too many nested for loops for gear updates, because of this when you update any gear it will cause client lock up for a moment, it doesnt not DC me but you might lose connection, fyi
