An Ashita v4 addon to help you pick the locks on brown treasure chests.

## Basics:

There are no commands, just talk to a brown treasure chest and it will open a imgui window to display the best guess. Try examining the lock a couple times to reduce the options and increase your chances of opening the chest. The gui will close when you either succeed or fail the chest.

## Notes:

- I have used this to open a couple hundred boxes in retail for my crafting torques and should work fine for anyone else on retail

## To Do:
