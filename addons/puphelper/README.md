# Pup Helper
An addon for Ashita v4 to do basic puppetmaster things automatically. Based on my runehelper addon for Ashita v4, inspired by pupper addon by Towbes for Ashita v3

Very straight forward to use, commands are:

/puphelper or /ph to hide or show the gui

/puphelper toggle or /ph toggle to engage or disengage

/puphelper set or /ph set with any three of dark|light|earth|wind|fire|ice|thunder|water to set maneuvers through keyboard input

Credit to Thorny for his gData.GetBuffCount function from the luashitacast addon, I modified it for my use case.

## To-Do's
Consider adding other inputs via keyboard
