# Rune Helper
An addon for Ashita v4 to use rune enchantments automatically based on your gui selections. It will also do automatic Viviacious Pulse use based on your gui selections.

Very straight forward to use, commands are:

/runehelper or /rh to hide|show the gui

/runehelper toggle or /rh toggle to engage/disengage

Credit to Thorny for his gData.GetBuffCount function from the luashitacast addon, I modified it for my use case.

## To-Do's
I might add valliance/valation use to this at some point in the future
