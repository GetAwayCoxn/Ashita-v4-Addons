# Auto Checker

An addon for Ashita v4 to check any newly targeted mob to assist in people who pull alot (mostly private servers of course). This is a quick and ghetto addon so if you tab through mobs really quick it will not check them all correctly/accurately since its using text command to check and not packets.

## Commands:

/achecker -- Will toggle on and off, gets auto toggled off in any city and on any zone change

## To-Do's
