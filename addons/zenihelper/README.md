# Zeni-Helper

Ashita v4 addon for FFXI to help with ZNM and PW farm tracking. Intended to be very simple display of what you have and what you need for items and keyitems and allows quick and easy spawning of NMs

## Basics:

/zh       -- show/hide

/zh trade -- with a correct ??? targeted and correct item in your main inventory will attempt to spawn your ZNM (will attempt auto trade within 5 yalms if correct item is in your main bag)

             
## Colors:

White  -- NM Name

Grey   -- Missing Items (Pop | Trophy)

Green  -- Items you have (Pop | Trophy)

Purple -- Missing Key Iems

Yellow -- Key Items you have

## Notes:

-Key Items update automatically

-Items and Jettons/Zeni amounts update each time the display is refreshed with /zh

-Double clicking anywhere in the window will hide as well

## To Do:

-Standing by for error fixes

-Might add some Sanraku interaction/trading in the future


## Current GUI:
